# azurehakua.moe

This is a simple static website built using a template called [Ethereal](https://html5up.net/ethereal) by HTML5 UP. It includes a responsive layout, easy customization, and fast loading times.

## About
- As a learning experiment, this website was built in order to learn about deployment and hosting of static websites via Cloudflare Pages. Originally, it was hosted on GitHub Pages, but I decided to move it to Cloudflare Pages for better performance and reliability in addition to scaling in the future.
- This process involved learning about Domains, DNS, Name Servers, and the Cloudflare platform.
- The website is hosted on Cloudflare Pages and is accessible at [azurehakua.moe](https://azurehakua.moe).

## Services
- Originally the domain was registered with Hover, but I ended up moving to Porkbun, which offers a more affordable price for domain registration (not to say that Hover was expensive, but I wanted to save some money).
- Cloudflare Pages is used for hosting the website, which features free SSL certificates and automatic deployments.
- The website was built using a Template, which has been common practice for learning and building simple websites. The process was as simple as downloading and uploading the template to GitHub, and then deploying it to Cloudflare Pages. Notably, some of the code (both HTML and CSS) needed to modified to fit my needs but also fix some bugs.

## Future Plans
- This landing page will serve as a placeholder for other projects that will use the same domain with a subdirectory or a subbdomain. I plan on launching a future project that encompases more of a full-stack web application.
